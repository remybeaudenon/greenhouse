# greenhouse
Polytech 45 Connected green house  -  MCU Heltec loRa V3  Ambient light BH1750

Project Objective
  The goal of this project is to design a connected IoT system that measures ambient light and controls a resistive heater in order to simulate solar irradiation.

For our laboratory experiences the relationship between solar irradiance and the energy supplied to the greenhouse must be as proportional as possible.

System Features
Ambient light monitoring to regulate the heating source.
Temperature sensor for heat regulation and frost protection.
Humidity sensor to control the environment through ventilation
Local display showing system status and fault information.
Push button to acknowledge system faults .
      Note : The greenhouse is already equipped with a 12 Volts 0.45 Watt fan. and heating element 10 ohms 25 Watts without its power supply unit.

Remote Supervision
     A dedicated remote supervision software enables real-time monitoring, control, and data visualization. 
     It also provides access to historical trends and weather forecasts for the next seven days. 
Energy Constraints
     Since the system is powered by a 12V solar supply, it is essential to implement strategies that minimize energy consumption while maintaining reliable operation. Based on the rought power need we envisage to install a  battery lead-acid : E=12V×8Ah=96Wh with a 25 Watts Solar panel .
